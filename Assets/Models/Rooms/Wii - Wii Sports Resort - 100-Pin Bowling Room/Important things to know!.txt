There are multiple mirror textures,

and the bowling balls are a little weird, so theres a texture (bwg_ball_alpha)
which are the little white lines on the ball, I made 4 different textures for each corresponding color, 
if you're using blender put the bwg_ball_alpha textures alpha channel into a Mix RGB's Fac input. Next insert the 
image texture on the first color input with the color texture of the ball. Switch the Mix RGB to Overlay and plug the
color into your principled BSDF!
